# STM32-Sunrise

Based on the Project I started on Hackaday quite some time ago. 

https://hackaday.io/project/2126-sunset-and-sunrise-camera-controller

The original code ran on a Maple Mini with a RTC module. 

This version is designed to be entirely STM32F103 based, with a relay or MOSFET to switch the camera battery.
